The Holistic Bias is the code which was the work of META {https://github.com/facebookresearch/ResponsibleNLP.git} and please it is not a original work. 

The files are added as we replicated to code for ourselves in the project, and we had made various tweaks working with vrious data sets. 

As for the The bias based on the perplexity charts that you would see for is infact an orignial code, and has been coded on the mathematcial intuition of entry based concepts.

The code is made public however, this is only a snap shot of the work done , If there is more insights needed, please feel free to contact :)


Cheers,
Sid :)
